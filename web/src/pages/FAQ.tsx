      <h2>How does your hiring process work?</h2>
      <p>
        We review every application. There are no automated keyword rejections. If
        we proceed, you’ll hear from us. If we don’t, silence does not mean
        disregard — it means timing or fit wasn’t right.
      </p>
      <h2>Do you use AI to evaluate candidates?</h2>
      <p>
        No automated decision-making is used to accept or reject candidates. Any
        tooling assists humans; it does not replace judgment.
      </p>
      <h2>How long does it take?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually 1–3 weeks depending on the role. We move carefully on purpose.
      </p>
      <h2>What do you value most?</h2>
      <p>
        Clarity, ethics, emotional intelligence, self-direction, and respect for
        others’ time.
      </p>
