      <h1>About URAI</h1>
      <p>URAI is not a typical technology company.</p>
      <p>
        We build systems that treat human memory, emotion, and identity as
        something worth protecting — not exploiting.
      </p>
      <p>That shapes how we hire.</p>
      <p>We don’t optimize for growth at all costs.</p>
      <p>We don’t rush decisions to feel busy.</p>
      <p>We don’t confuse pressure with importance.</p>
      <p>We believe good work comes from calm, clarity, and trust.</p>
      <p>If you’re applying here, you should know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We care about how things are built, not just that they work
        </li>
        <li>We value restraint as much as ambition</li>
        <li>We hire people we trust to think, not just execute</li>
      </ul>
      <p>URAI is long-term by design. So is our hiring.</p>
