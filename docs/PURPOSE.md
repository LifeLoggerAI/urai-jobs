urai-jobs exists to support ethical, calm, human-centered hiring.

It is not a growth surface.
It is not a marketing funnel.
It is not an optimization playground.

Any change must preserve:

- Applicant dignity
- Human review
- Minimal data collection
- Low-pressure interaction

If a change threatens these, the change is rejected.
